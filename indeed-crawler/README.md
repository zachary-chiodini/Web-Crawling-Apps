Run python build.py to compile the program. The resuting job-crawler-beta.exe is equiped with a graphical user interface. The program uses Selenium to access the job search website and a sentence embedding model to answer screening questions, based on what the user enters into the Requirements Document on the graphical user interface. The user must have a job search account and their resume uploaded to the account before running the program to begin applying to jobs.
