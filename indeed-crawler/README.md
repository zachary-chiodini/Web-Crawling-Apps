Run "python build.py" in the indeed-crawler directory to compile the program. The resuting job-crawler-beta.exe is equiped with a graphical user interface. The program uses Selenium to access the job search website and a word embedding model to answer screening questions, based on what the user enters into the Requirements Document on the graphical user interface. The user must have a job search account and their resume uploaded to the account before running the program to begin applying to jobs. 

The fasstext word embedding model can be downloaded [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html). The program is currently set to use the cc.en.100.bin model, which is the cc.en.300.bin model which has been reduced to 100 dimensions for ease of use.
